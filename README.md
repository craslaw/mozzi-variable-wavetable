# mozzi-variable-wavetable
THIS DOES NOT WORK AS INTENDED

This is a work in progress. The pitch knob doesn't seem to be mapped to the correct range of values. This is based on https://github.com/craslaw/mozzi-variable-vibrato, but for some reason the pitch knob doesn't behave in the same way it did in the previous project.
